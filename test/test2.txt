An interesting thing about texting and tweeting is that it’s an informal way of writing language down. It’s different from other forms like letters, contracts, receipts, or even email in some cases because those are a formal way of writing. So there are conventions: there’s an introductory line where you have to put a comma, you have to put the date in a specific place, you have to use a certain form of language that people generally perceive as very formal. If you don’t use the formal language, it gives maybe the wrong impression. If you use very casual language, if you use slang in a letter or a formal message written down, then it isn’t seen as proper, and we’re taught that in schools — in elementary school, and many of us have been learning this for years and years.

But when you get to text messaging or tweeting, there aren’t really rules for that that we’ve been taught. They are more informal. They are quick. They are intended to be more like those quickly written notes that you pass to your friends in class, or a quick note to yourself, a reminder of something that’s interesting that you might not have a formal way of writing these things down. Without those constraints of structure being very formal, then we have room to play. People can express themselves in a certain style in using different means of language that can show that they’re a little bit different than everybody else. They have their own way of writing, just as we have our own way of speaking to each other.

When you’re speaking a language, we can be in more formal situations and informal situations as well. So, a formal situation might be something like a podcast interview or a job interview or a public lecture where you’re expected to use a certain kind of language. But when you’re speaking to your friends, when you’re out at a bar, when you’re talking on the phone, maybe to your close family, you can use more informal language and a little bit more of your style. Your own personal way of speaking can come out.

That’s what text messaging, and to some extent for some people, tweets, can do for written language. They give us a chance to express more of our own personal style. And people do that with different forms of so-called nonstandard written language, like lowercase letters, removing punctuation, using slang, using abbreviations and emoji, and all kinds of things.

Ashley: Do you think that we’re more formal over email because it’s just an older form than texting? I’m curious why email, which is still very internet-based... it’s not a letter. I can understand what you’re saying where growing up you learn “Dear blah blah blah... Sincerely,” in the letter and how it’s supposed to be formatted. But why is email spared of these strange conventions?

That’s a great question, and I don’t think it’s the same for everybody. So for people who have been using email and the internet for a long time through our lives, it is a very flexible medium where it could be something formal where you actually have a “Dear so and so. I am writing to inquire about your open position.” You can have a closing and a signature line. If you use email a lot for work, it might be formal in those cases. But then, if you go and you email your friend to make plans for when they come to visit, then it might turn into something less formal.

I’ve noticed that some people who are now in high school, my stepdaughter, for example, think that email is very formal because that’s what you use to communicate with your teachers. It’s associated with school or it’s associated with more formal things that people are starting to associate with a formal style of language. And it does have some of the aspects. It can have, and often does have, some of those aspects of a letter. There’s like a “dear so and so,” an introduction, a closing. Especially if you use a signature line, that can signal some of those letter-like components and cue us to use more formal language. Of course, it’s different for everybody. And it depends on, for many people, what you’re using your email for. It’s more of the situation than the medium.
